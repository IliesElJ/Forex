# FOREX Market Movement Prediction

This repository summarizes the outcomes of our statistical project aimed at predicting movements in the FOREX market. Our team, guided by Alexandre Torre from QuantCube Technology, embarked on an exploration to understand the intricate relationships between currency pairs using advanced data analytics and econometric models.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To develop reliable investment strategies for currency pairs using alternative macroeconomic data.
- **Methodology**: We employed a variety of statistical techniques, including regression analysis, correlation studies, and performance measurement using financial indicators such as the Sharpe ratio.
- **Results**: Our analysis revealed significant insights into the sensitivity of currency pairs to various economic sectors and indicators. The strategies tested demonstrated potential for predicting currency movements with statistical significance.

## Key Findings

- The project highlighted the importance of macroeconomic indicators in forecasting FOREX market trends.
- Regression models and performance indicators like the Sharpe ratio played a crucial role in assessing strategy robustness.
- Our strategies, based on a comprehensive analysis of economic data, provide a solid foundation for future investment decision-making in the FOREX market.

## Future Directions

The insights gained from this project pave the way for further research into macroeconomic influences on currency markets and the development of more sophisticated investment strategies.
